Spiderweb
---------
Each pathmark documents the sites a user navigated through before finding their desired information.

An optional setting in the Pathmarks extension allows users to anonymously send their pathmarks to Spiderweb.
Spiderweb aggregates the pathmarks to provide recommendations based on a given URL.

Installing the Pathmark Chrome Extension adds an item to the context menu accessed by right-clicking in any website.

#### To open the Spiderweb for any site:
1. Have the Pathmark extension installed in the Google Chrome browser
(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pathmarks/pljlfppjejnlldkimmillfglpmdbhjek)
2. Right click on any page
3. Select "Follow the Spiders"
